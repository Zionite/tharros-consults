                <p>Lead Coach</p>
                <p>Hello, my name is Ese, it’s lovely to meet you!<br>How does a person successfully navigate the “what if's” that come with transitioning in order to succeed at their chosen career path? The uncertainty, nervousness, and ambiguity of it all. I know firsthand what it’s like to start something new, what it’s like to transition between different career paths, and what it’s like to have to start over. The best part is that I truly love to help people do just that - excel at their careers and businesses.</p>
                <p>Having successfully helped a lot of people start and transition between career paths, I have found that in 8 out of 10 times, folks just need someone to handhold them so that they can see and be confident in what’s already within them. That’s what I am here to do!</p>
                <p>I am a Certified Product Manager and Lead Consultant with over 10 years of professional experience that cuts across Banking, Academia, & IT Consulting. I have successfully transitioned between roles in Trade Finance, Entrepreneurship academic Research, and IT Management. I also have a Master's degree in International Business Management. Now that you’ve heard about me, I would love to hear from you and share in your success story. Let’s connect.</p>
